# ECE404
A repo filled with the homework assignments and coding problems for the Introduction to Computer Security course at Purdue University (Spring 2023).

The first half of the course had a great focus on the cryptographic side of computer security with concepts ranging from encryption, rings, groups, and even security algorithms like DES, AES, and RSA. The second half of the course delved deeper into the system security concepts and more application-based lectures and assignments followed.
