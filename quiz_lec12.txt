Totient of prime number: 
a^phi(n) = 1 (mod n)

Totient of a product of two prime numbers:
phi(n) = phi(p) * phi(q) = (p-1)*(q-1)


Constraint on the relationship between message integer M and modulus N
How does the RSA algo get around that constraint?
M >= n, 


Relationship between public exponent e and private exponent d
d is an inverse of e (e: encryption, d: decryption) (modular inversion)
